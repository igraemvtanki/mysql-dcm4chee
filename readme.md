## dockerized-mariadb-for-dcm4chee
Docker image that provides a MariaDB instance for DCM4CHEE 5.x

Based on https://github.com/dcm4che-dockerfiles/postgres-dcm4chee

Migrated from https://github.com/opendicom/dockerized-dcm4chee-mariadb

There are a couple of compose files available on the `docker-compose` directory that bootstap replicated nodes.
The simplest one starts a local environment with two containers. The purpose of the other two (`host_one.yml` and `host_two.yml`) is to test the replication with containers running on separate docker hosts.

Let's start with the local environment. Get it up by running
`docker-compose up`. After that, get inside the first container by executing
`docker exec -ti db_node_one bash` and:

- Start a mysql session: `mysql -psecure awesome`
- Get the status of the cluster: `SHOW STATUS LIKE 'wsrep_cluster_size';`
- Insert a row in some random table: `insert into code (pk) values(123);`

Now read that row from the other node. Get inside it by executing `docker exec -ti db_node_two bash` and:

- Start a mysql session: `mysql -psecure awesome`
- Get the status of the cluster: `SHOW STATUS LIKE 'wsrep_cluster_size';`
- Read from the table: `select * from code;`

##### Node One:
